Adam has learnt to send messages now!!!!
Send your student timetable to you every day on WhatsApp Messenger using Twilio.

# Requirements

Of course, sending your student timetable is just one of the capabilities that you can use Twilio's API for to use the code u need the following requirements:

1) Python 2 or 3 

2) WhatsApp Messenger

3) An account on Twilio with the right details to allow the capibilty to send messages on WhatsApp Messenger

4) An account on Way Script this will allow you to execute code at certain times of the day 

So firstly you open up your favourite editor and use the code I provided as a template change the times if it is necessary as you will have different classes and modules and times.     

Next, go to twilio.com and set up an account -> https://www.twilio.com/

They walk you through how to obtain the Account SID and Account Auth.

Where the fields are for Account SID and Account Auth enter the credentials you obtained from your new Twilio account.

Next start up a sandbox in WhatsApp keep this open as long as you want messages sent to your phone

Next Create a way script account -> (https://wayscript.com/) and from way script create a new script name it anything 
you want then add a new trigger the trigger that will be added must be the 
time trigger set what time to send in the mornings will be ideal then add a new step the step must be Python now either insert a file or open way scripts editor either way now take the code 
I wrote and put it into the Python step and if the sandbox is open 24/7 it should send the student timetable in the times you specified.


Thank You for taking the time to read this.
